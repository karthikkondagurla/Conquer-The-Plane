# Conquer The Plane - Wormhole & Survival

A Unity 3D project featuring a persistent world exploration mechanic with wormholes, intelligent enemy AI, dynamic ranking systems, and survival gameplay.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🌌 Wormhole System
-   **Dynamic Teleportation**: Seamlessly travel between different maps (Bootstrap, Map 1-4) using wormholes.
-   **Persistence**: Player state (velocity, position relative to wormhole) and Camera are preserved across scene transitions.
-   **Relocation**: Wormholes dynamically change their spawn locations every 5-60 seconds, keeping the traversal unpredictable.

### 🤖 Advanced Enemy AI
-   **State Machine**: Enemies switch between **Patrol** (Roaming) and **Chase** (Targeting Player) states.
-   **Persistence**: Enemies follow the player's progression. They are not destroyed when you leave a scene, keeping the world alive.
-   **Global Tracking**: An `EnemyManager` tracks the total number of enemies across all maps.

### 📊 Dynamic Ranking UI
-   **Real-Time Leaderboard**: A minimalist Top-Left dashboard displays the "Danger Level" of each map.
-   **Live Updates**: The ranking sorts maps based on the current number of active enemies.
-   **Compact Design**: Clean, non-intrusive UI that merges map names and counts into a unified style.

### ❤️ Survival System (New!)
-   **Health Mechanics**: 
    -   Player starts with 100 HP.
    -   Touching enemies deals continuous damage over time.
    -   Avoiding damage for 2 seconds triggers auto-regeneration.
-   **HUD**: A Top-Right Health Bar visualizes your current status.
-   **Game Over**: Death triggers a "GAME OVER" screen with an option to return to the Main Menu.

### 🎮 Game Flow
-   **Main Menu**: Start the game or Quit.
-   **Randomized Setup**: Each run distributes exactly **9 Enemies** randomly across the 4 maps, ensuring replayability.
-   **Objective**: Survive as long as possible while exploring the wormhole network!

## 🛠️ Technical Details
-   **Persistent Singletons**: `EnemyManager`, `RankingCanvas` survive scene loads.
-   **Editor Tools**: Custom `Tools > Setup Wormhole Test` script to auto-generate the entire scene hierarchy, materials, and physics setup.
-   **Tag System**: Automated tag registration ("SpawnPoint", "Enemy") to prevent runtime errors.

## 🚀 How to Play
1.  Open `Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity`.
2.  Press **Play**.
3.  Click **PLAY** to start.
4.  **Controls**:
    -   Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to roll the ball.
    -   Enter **Magenta Spheres** (Wormholes) to teleport.
    -   **Avoid Black Cubes** (Enemies) to stay alive!
